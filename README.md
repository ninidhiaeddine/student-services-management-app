# Student Services Management Application (Mobile Version)
A mobile application that allows students to manage their reservations of university services with a click of a button.
This application was developed for a school project in the American University of Beirut. The course's name is **CMPS 297N - Mobile Development.**

## Tech Stack:
* Frontend: **Android Native (Java)**
* Backend: **ASP .NET Web API** ([GitHub repo here!](https://github.com/ninidhiaeddine/student-services-management-api))
* Database: **MySQL**

## The aim of the application:
In university, reservations are usually made through calls or physical sign up sheets.
Thus, our application aims to facilitate the process of reservations by a click of a button
from the comfort of their phone. The application allows students to reserve time slots
for the gym and pool, in addition to dorm students being able to sign up for laundry and
room cleaning services.

## Functionalities of the application:
### As a student you are able to:
1. Sign up and sign in using your AUB email
3. View and reserve the time slot you want for each of the services provided ie.
Laundry, dorm cleaning, swimming pool and gym
4. You are able to cancel a reservation
5. Receive a “ticket” with a scannable Qr code for your reservation

### As an admin you are able to:
1. Sign up and sign in using AUB email
4. Set up and edit time slots / capacity
5. Scan QR code for a reservation

##  Missing features (Features yet to be implemented)
